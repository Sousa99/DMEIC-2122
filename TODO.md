    - [GLoVE Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/glove_python/#description)

<br/>

- Implement **Latent Content Analysis** üü°

    Following the methodology of Rezaii et al. the model will atempt to evaluate how different the semantics of each groups is. For this purpose it is requried to exist an already defined sepparation of the dataset inton train and test.
