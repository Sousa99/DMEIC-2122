# DMEIC-2122

This repository was created with the intent to host everything that has been worked on during the master's thesis of **Computer Sciences and Engineering**. Important to note that **no** **data** or important **documentation** is stored in this repository, merely the work in terms of code or literature done for the thesis.

---

## Literature Review üìñ
**Directory:** `./papers/`

In the mentioned directory a review of literature for the thesis has been done. For each paper/study a **resume** and **critique** has been done, as well as a **stats spreadsheet**, which is automatically generated from the resumes through commmands hidden in the comments. This spreadsheet identifies, for each study:
- Summary: title, authors, and publication date
- Start and end day of the analysis
- Symptoms of psychosis
- Thecniques for the identification of psychosis
- Metrics for the identification of psychosis
- Problems identified in the study
- Pottentially usefull citations

Scripts were also developed for the automatization of certain tasks such as:
- Exportation of all the latex files developed as PDFs ‚û°Ô∏è `./papers/scripts_latex/export.sh`
- Cleanup of temporary files for the exportation previously mentioned ‚û°Ô∏è `./papers/scripts_latex/cleanup.sh`
- Automatic generation of a new summary and critique from a given template for each (in `./papers/latex/templates`) ‚û°Ô∏è `./papers/scripts_latex/start_new.sh`
- Installing of packages for latex ‚û°Ô∏è `./papers/scripts_latex/install_packages.sh`
- Creation of the previously mentioned spreadsheet ‚û°Ô∏è `./papers/create_spreadsheet.py`
- Automatic uploading of the pertinent documents to a shared Google Drive for the thesis ‚û°Ô∏è `./papers/upload_to_shared_drive.py`

## Data Acquisition and Treatment üíæ
**Directory:** `./data/`

Although the data itself is not available in the repository, it is still important to mention its structure, in the eventuality that the entire repository needs to be replicated in another computer.
