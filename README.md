# DMEIC-2122

This repository was created with the intent to host everything that has been worked on during the master's thesis of **Computer Sciences and Engineering**. Important to note that **no** **data** or important **documentation** is stored in this repository, merely the work in terms of code or literature done for the thesis.

---

## Literature Review üìñ
**Directory:** `./papers/`

In the mentioned directory a review of literature for the thesis has been done. For each paper/study a **resume** and **critique** has been done, as well as a **stats spreadsheet**, which is automatically generated from the resumes through commmands hidden in the comments. This spreadsheet identifies, for each study:
- Summary: title, authors, and publication date
- Start and end day of the analysis
- Symptoms of psychosis
- Thecniques for the identification of psychosis
- Metrics for the identification of psychosis
- Problems identified in the study
- Pottentially usefull citations

Scripts were also developed for the automatization of certain tasks such as:
- Exportation of all the latex files developed as PDFs ‚û°Ô∏è [`./papers/scripts_latex/export.sh`](./papers/scripts_latex/export.sh)
- Cleanup of temporary files for the exportation previously mentioned ‚û°Ô∏è [`./papers/scripts_latex/cleanup.sh`](./papers/scripts_latex/cleanup.sh)
- Automatic generation of a new summary and critique from a given template for each (in [`./papers/latex/templates`](./papers/latex/templates)) ‚û°Ô∏è [`./papers/scripts_latex/start_new.sh`](./papers/scripts_latex/start_new.sh)
- Installing of packages for latex ‚û°Ô∏è [`./papers/scripts_latex/install_packages.sh`](./papers/scripts_latex/install_packages.sh)
- Creation of the previously mentioned spreadsheet ‚û°Ô∏è [`./papers/create_spreadsheet.py`](./papers/create_spreadsheet.py)
- Automatic uploading of the pertinent documents to a shared Google Drive for the thesis ‚û°Ô∏è [`./papers/upload_to_shared_drive.py`](./papers/upload_to_shared_drive.py)

## Data Acquisition and Treatment üíæ
**Directory:** `./data/`

Although the data itself is not available in the repository, it is still important to mention its structure, in the eventuality that the entire repository needs to be replicated in another computer.

## Data Analysis üìä
**Directory:** `./analysis/`

General profilling of the corpus.

---

## Results üéâ
**Directory:** `./results/`

Results achieved with classifiers on the existent corpus.

## General Pipeline Execution üèÉ

1.  Data is first acquired by recording a subject appropriately, during the entirety of the execution of the protocol, according to the *type* of the subject, if it is ...
    1. A **Control** subject, then the recording is imediatelly placed in folder [recordings/controls_uncut](./data/recordings/controls_uncut/)
    2. A **Patient** subject, then the recording is imediatelly placed on the folder [recordings/to_identify](./data/recordings/to_identify/)

<br/>

2.  Each recording is listened to in order to propperly identify the timestamps at which the subject is executing each task, as to propperly segment the original recording. This timestamps are then placed on [recordings/controls_cutting_times.json](./data/recordings/controls_cutting_times.json) or [recordings/to_identify_cutting_times.json](./data/recordings/to_identify_cutting_times.json) depending on if it is a control subject or a patient with unknown diagnosis.

<br/>

3.  Information (id for anonimity and socio-demographic information) is saved, once again depending on whether the subject is a control or a patient with diagnosis still to identify on [control_info.xlsx](./data/control_info.xlsx) or [to_identify_info.xlsx](./data/to_identify_info.xlsx).

<br/>

4.  Now the uniqueness of the ids must be checked. For this the script [scripts/check_conflicts_ids.sh](./data/scripts/check_conflicts_ids.sh) must be executed. In fact this script checks for the uniqueness of the id on the entire corpus, although the uniqueness could be exclusive for the group where the patient is inserted since each id will be appended to a tag (*c_*, *p_*, and *b_*, for controls, patients with psychosis, and patients with bipolar disorder respectively).

<br/>

5.  At some point the diagnoses of the various patients with unknown diagnoses will be known, and at that point the recordings, the timestamps and the information will need to be moved from the various files and folder associated with **to_identify** into **psychosis** or **bipolars**.

<br/>

6.  After the various recordings have been propperly sorted out and correctly placed in their individual folders they need now to be split up, as to have one recording for each subject and task. For this purpose, the script [scripts/cut_audios.py](./data/scripts/cut_audios.py), must be executed, one time for each one of the groups of subjects.
